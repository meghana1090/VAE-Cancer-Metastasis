# VAE-Cancer-Metastasis
This project uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to identify key drivers of cancer metastasis by encoding high-dimensional gene expression data into a low-dimensional space. Combining constrained optimization and co-occurrence network analysis, it uncovers critical genes and gene pairs for potential biomarkers and targeted therapies.
