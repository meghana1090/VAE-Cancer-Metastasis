This project uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to identify key drivers of cancer metastasis by encoding high-dimensional gene expression data into a low-dimensional space. Combining constrained optimization and co-occurrence network analysis, it uncovers critical genes and gene pairs for potential biomarkers and targeted therapies. This repo includes all of the datasets used in the study, along with the optimization and model code for replication.
